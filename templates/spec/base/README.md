## TL;DR
- **Purpose**: Standardized format for software development task specifications
- **Core principle**: Clear, complete, testable, traceable
- **5-section structure**: Context, Requirements, Implementation Steps, Acceptance Criteria, Links
- **Key files**: task-template.md (template), constraints.md (rules), conventions.md (patterns)
- **Commands**: /fluid-make-task, /fluid-run-task, /fluid-task-engineer, /fluid-dev-agent

Welcome to FluidSpec - a structured approach to software development task specifications.

## What is FluidSpec?

FluidSpec is a standardized format for creating clear, actionable software development tasks. It ensures consistency across your team and helps bridge the gap between product requirements and technical implementation.

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity**: Every task should be clear and unambiguous
2. **Completeness**: All necessary information included upfront
3. **Testability**: Acceptance criteria that can be verified
4. **Traceability**: Links to related work and documentation

## Task Structure

Every FluidSpec task includes:

- **Context**: The why behind the task
- **Requirements**: What needs to be built (functional and non-functional)
- **Implementation Steps**: How to approach the solution
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Links**: References to related work

## Getting Started

1. Use the `task-template.md` as a starting point
2. Fill in all sections with specific details
3. Review with your team before implementation
4. Use Claude commands to assist with task creation and execution

## Best Practices

- Write requirements before implementation
- Make acceptance criteria testable
- Include non-functional requirements
- Link to relevant documentation
- Update tasks as requirements evolve

## Claude Commands

Use these commands to work with FluidSpec:

- `/fluid-make-task` - Create new FluidSpec tasks
- `/fluid-run-task` - Execute FluidSpec tasks
- `/fluid-task-engineer` - Design task specifications
- `/fluid-dev-agent` - Implement tasks
- `/fluid-task-manager` - Manage task lifecycle
